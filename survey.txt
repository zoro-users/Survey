They provide visual interfaces that simplify complex tasks, offer immediate visual feedback. GUIs contribute to a positive user experience by creating visually satisfying interfaces, ultimately allowing seamless interaction between users and electronic devices.

2. Historic Perspective
2.2 Early developments
In the early days of computing, users communicated with machines using text based commands, which was difficult, complex and technical knowledge was required. In the 1970s, the development of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) evolved by introducing visual elements like icons, menus, pointers and windows. 
The Xerox Alto, developed in 1973, was one of the first computers to feature a GUI with a mouse for navigation, though the system never reached commercial production.
 The first commercially available computer with a GUI was the 1979 PERQ workstation, manufactured by Three Rivers Computer Corporation. 
Apple Computer brought out the first Macintosh in 1984. It became the first all-in-one personal computer to be a mass-market success.
 The original Macintosh computer was designed to make computing more accessible to non-technical users.The first version of Windows was released on November 20, 1985, as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces (GUIs). 
Since then, GUIs have continued to evolve, becoming more intuitive and feature-rich, enabling users to interact with computers in more natural and user-friendly ways. Today, GUIs are present in various electronic devices, from smartphones to smart appliances, shaping the way we interact with technology on a daily basis.
