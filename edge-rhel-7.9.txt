To install Microsoft Edge on RHEL 7.9 using commands without downloading the RPM package manually, follow these steps:

1. Ensure yum-config-manager is available
Before adding the repository, ensure you have the yum-utils package installed, as it provides the yum-config-manager utility. If it's not already installed, you can install it by running:

sudo yum install yum-utils



2. Add Microsoft Edge repository:
Run the following command to add the Microsoft Edge repository:


sudo rpm --import https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc
sudo yum config-manager --add-repo https://packages.microsoft.com/yumrepos/edge

3. Update your package index
After adding the repository, it's a good idea to refresh your package index. This ensures that yum is aware of the new packages available from the Microsoft Edge repository you just added:

sudo yum makecache

4. Install Microsoft Edge:
Once the repository is added, you can install Microsoft Edge using yum:

sudo yum update
sudo yum install microsoft-edge-stable

5. Launch Microsoft Edge:
After installation, you can launch Microsoft Edge from the application menu or by typing 		"microsoft-edge" 			in the terminal.
